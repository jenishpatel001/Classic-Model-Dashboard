Classic Model Dashboard

This repository hosts the "Classic Model Dashboard," a comprehensive data visualization project designed to provide actionable insights from the Classic Models dataset. The dashboard, accessible [here](https://github.com/jenishpatel001/Classic-Model-Dashboard/blob/main/Classic%20data.PNG), was crafted using skills honed through the "Data Analysis | SQL, Tableau, Power BI & Excel | Real Projects" course on Udemy, completed on September 6, 2025. It features interactive visualizations and key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales trends, product performance, and customer segmentation, built using Tableau and Power BI, with data processed and cleaned using SQL and Excel.

The development process involved extracting and querying data from the Classic Models database with SQL, transforming it into a structured format, and creating a user-friendly interface to display the results. The dashboard highlights my ability to handle real-world data challenges, including data integration, visualization design, and performance optimization. Created as part of a 12.5-hour intensive training led by instructor Graeme Gordon, this project serves as a practical demonstration of my data analysis capabilities.

Future enhancements may include adding more advanced analytics, incorporating real-time data feeds, and refining the user interface based on feedback. Feel free to explore the dashboard, suggest improvements, or collaborate on expanding its features!
