Classic Model Dashboard
This repository contains the "Classic Model Dashboard," a data visualization project developed as part of my learning journey in data analysis. The dashboard, accessible here, showcases my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights using modern tools and techniques.
Project Overview
The dashboard was created using skills acquired from the "Data Analysis | SQL, Tableau, Power BI & Excel | Real Projects" course on Udemy, completed on September 6, 2025. Over 12.5 hours of intensive training under instructor Graeme Gordon, I mastered SQL for database querying, Tableau and Power BI for interactive visualizations, and Excel for data manipulation. This project reflects real-world applications, including data cleaning, trend analysis, and the design of an intuitive dashboard to support business decision-making.
